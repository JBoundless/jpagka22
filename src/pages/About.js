      <p>
        My name is Jordan Pagkalinawan, a high school student who lives in
        Southern California. Some of my interests include politics, basketball,
        and writing. I've spent over half my life covering stories in my
        neighborhood and posting them to my YouTube channel. I'm also a
        musician, with experience singing and playing the drums, guitar, and
        piano. Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, coding, and
        reading. I'm an avid consumer of news and I love reading about the ways
        that journalism has changed society. I'm also interested in seeing how
        programming will shape our world as devices are continuously added to
        restaurants, sporting arenas, and even around neighborhoods.

      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        My role as a student is to constantly learn about new concepts and, when
        called for, apply them into my daily life. That role continues to evolve
        as a student journalist and a computer programmer. With journalism, I
        absorb current events as well as stories about the industry. As a
        programmer, my interest in Web Development requires me to be creative
        and find new outlets for such creativity. Personally, I still have a lot
        to learn with regards to my future. It’s been cemented into my brain
        that journalism is for me. I ponder what I could do in addition to a
        career in the news industry. Given the option, do I minor in Computer
        Science to enhance my reporting skills? Do I finally decide to pursue a
        Musical Theater minor because it’s another storytelling outlet? Should I
        freelance with Data Visualization or with VIdeography? These are the
        questions that, at the moment, I still do not know the answer to.
        However, I find that I am lucky to have these options available. Curious
        minds are what we need in the world today. Whether we have the mindset
        of changing the world or just trying to figure out how we will spend our
        adult life, I believe it is crucial to prepare for the future so that we
        are not at a crossroads when we face these decisions.
